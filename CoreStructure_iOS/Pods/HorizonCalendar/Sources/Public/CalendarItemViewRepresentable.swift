/// protocol, `CalendarView` is able to treat each view it displays as a function of its `invariantViewProperties` and its
/// `content`, simplifying the initialization and state updating of views.

  /// view.
  ///
  /// If your view does not depend on any variable data, then `Content` can be `Never` and `setContent(_:on)` does not
  /// need to be implemented. This is not common, since most views used in the calendar change what they display based on the
  /// parameters passed into the `*itemProvider*` closures (e.g. the current day, month, or day range layout context information).

  /// `content` updates.

  ///   - invariantViewProperties: An instance containing all of the immutable / initial setup values necessary to initialize the
