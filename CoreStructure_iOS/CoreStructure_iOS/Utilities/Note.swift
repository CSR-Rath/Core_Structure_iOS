//Architectural design patterns used in software development:
// MVC
// MVVM
//MARK: MVC (Model-View-Controller)

//MARK: Model: Represents the data and business logic. It retrieves data and responds to requests for information.

//MARK: View: Displays the data (the user interface). It listens for user interactions and updates the UI.

//MARK: Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It processes user input, manipulates the model, and updates the view.
